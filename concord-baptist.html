      <h3 class="event-title">Shirley Chisholm (1924-2005)</h3>
      <p class="event-description">
        Shirley Chisholm made history on January 25, 1972, when she announced her candidacy for President of the United States from the historic Concord Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. As the first Black woman to seek the nomination of a major political party, her campaign challenged societal norms and political barriers, the choice of Concord Baptist Church as the announcement venue was significant. It was not only a cornerstone of Brooklyn’s Black community but also a hub for civil rights activism and grassroots organizing. This marked a pivotal moment in both her career and the broader fight for representation and equity in American politics.      </p>

        Alice W. Wiley Seay (1858–1937) was a prominent community leader and activist associated with Concord Baptist Church in Brooklyn. She founded the Empire State Federation of Women’s Clubs in 1908, uniting Black women's organizations across New York to tackle issues such as education, civil rights, and social upliftment. Her leadership extended to the establishment of the Brooklyn NAACP Chapter, where she worked to combat systemic racism and advocate for equal opportunities for African Americans.Alice’s pioneering efforts laid the groundwork for many future leaders, including Shirley Chisholm, who was also affiliated with the NAACP.     </p>
