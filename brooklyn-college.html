      <p class="event-description">
        1467 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn served as the campaign headquarters for Shirley Chisholm during her groundbreaking 1972 presidential run. Located in the heart of Bedford-Stuyvesant, this space was a hub of grassroots organizing and community activism, reflecting the vibrant energy of her historic campaign. After Chisholm left the space at 1467 Bedford, it was used periodically for political events, but soon fell into disrepair and disuse. After recent renovation, while maintaining the appearance of Chisholm’s original office, it was taken over by Alpha Space. As Alpha Space, the building became host of a generous variety of events and programs, ranging from comedy shows to publicly recorded podcasts to dinner get-togethers. Source: Untapped cities.
