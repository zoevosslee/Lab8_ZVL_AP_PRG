      <h3 class="event-title">Shirley Chisholm (1924-2005)</h3>
      <p class="event-description">
        At Brooklyn College, Shirley Chisholm majored in sociology and minored in Spanish, graduating cum laude in 1946. She was a debating champion, member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, and an active leader in student organizations such as the Harriett Tubman Society and Pan-American Club. When a social club refused to accept Black students, Chisholm founded an alternative club and was also a founding member of IPOTHIA (In Pursuit of the Highest in All). In a Political Science course, her professor, Louis Warsoff, recognized her political potential, setting the stage for her future activism.      </p>
